                GetTrace returns a single trace.
                 Note that the JSON response over HTTP is wrapped into result envelope "{"result": ...}"
                 It means that the JSON response cannot be directly unmarshalled using JSONPb.
                 This can be fixed by first parsing into user-defined envelope with standard JSON library
                 or string manipulation to remove the envelope. Alternatively generate objects using OpenAPI.

                        attributes is a collection of key/value pairs. Note, global attributes
                         like server name can be set using the resource API. Examples of attributes:

                 not implement the OTLP protocol.

                 The main difference between this message and collector protocol is that
                 in this message there will not be any "control" or "metadata" specific to
                 OTLP protocol.

                 When new fields are added into this message, the OTLP request MUST be updated
                 as well.
