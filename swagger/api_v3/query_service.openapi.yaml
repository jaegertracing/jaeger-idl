                     precise limits, and a larger value generally results in more traces being returned.

                GetTrace returns a single trace.
                 Note that the JSON response over HTTP is wrapped into result envelope "{"result": ...}"
                 It means that the JSON response cannot be directly unmarshalled using JSONPb.
                 This can be fixed by first parsing into user-defined envelope with standard JSON library
                 or string manipulation to remove the envelope. Alternatively generate objects using OpenAPI.

                KeyValueList is a list of KeyValue messages. We need KeyValueList as a message
                 since `oneof` in AnyValue does not allow repeated fields. Everywhere else where we need
                 a list of KeyValue messages (e.g. in Span) we use `repeated KeyValue` directly to
                 avoid unnecessary extra wrapping (which slows down the protocol). The 2 approaches
                 are semantically equivalent.

            description: The `Link object` represents a possible design-time link for a response. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known relationship and traversal mechanism between responses and other operations.  Unlike _dynamic_ links (i.e. links provided **in** the response payload), the OAS linking mechanism does not require link information in the runtime response.  For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a runtime expression is used for accessing values in an operation and using them as parameters while invoking the linked operation.
